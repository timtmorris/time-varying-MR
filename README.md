# Time varying MR

This page contains all of the materials neccessary to run the analyses presented in: _Morris TT. Heron J. Sanderson E. Davey SMith G. Tilling K. Interpretation of mendelian randomization using one measure of an exposure that varies over time_. 

The Stata do file "tvmr_simulations_programme.do" can be used to run all analyses, present all tables and save all figures that are in the manuscript. Analysts can choose to vary the parameters used in the manuscript to assess the performance of MR under differing scenarios. 

For any questions please contact Tim Morris: tim.morris@bristol.ac.uk.
